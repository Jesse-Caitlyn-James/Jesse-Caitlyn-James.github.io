                <p>Hey there, my name is Jesse.</p>
                <p>I am a current Griffith University student on the Gold Coast studying ICT. I've been studying IT and other technological courses on and off for half a decade, including technical theatre, a certificate III in ICT and currently a diploma in ICT, so I've picked up a few skills and a healthy knowledge base. I aim to continue developing my skills and knowledge and become a talented Software Developer and/or Computer Engineer. I strive to teach any useful skills I have to those around me with the idea that life will become easier for everyone the more knowledge and talents we all share. I have quite a few soft skills from my different experiences in life that I hope will make my journey a little easier and I am always committed to learning new skills and regularly rise to my potential quickly, I pride myself in maintaining a consistent quality of work, ethic and enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>This Portfolio is meant to be an introduction to what mindset and abilities I can bring to an organisation or project. Through this portfolio I hope to showcase my passions, motivation to grow, goals for success, skills and history.</p>
                <p>I look forward to seeing where I take myself in the world and all the new relationships and skills I will develop along the way.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="about1">
                <p>I am an aspiring software developer from Cairns, in the Far North Queensland. I love to solve problems and come to creative solutions to them. I'm always looking forward to ways to diversify my skills and learn something new.</p>
                <p>I look to create new and innovative solutions to current problems. I want to use my skills to design and implement technology that will improve the lives of many. Most of all I want to be able to always reflect back on what i've done and what I did to get there.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about1">
                <p>I graduated high school in 2020 after pursuing biology and spending my free time managing AV and lighting in the theatre. In 2021 I completed a Certificate 3 in ICT at TAFE QLD where I explored my love for computer hardware and software development. After taking a gap year to work I am now in Griffith University studying a Diploma in ICT which I expect to graduate with at the end of this year, where I look forward to starting a Bachelors in ICT majoring in software development.</p>
                <p>I'm pursuing a degree in ICT with a Major in Software Development. I'm looking to take primarily software development course with the goal in mind of getting a broad knowledge base and skillset across many coding languages and applications. I aim to be an valuable member of any team with an in depth knowledge of many languages and ways of solving problems in the future. My elective subjects will be quite similiar with many software development and application courses, with the inclusion of some circuit and hardware courses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about1">
                <p>I aim to become a strong software developer. My goal is to be a valuable part of a team creating leading innovations and resources for the world. I'm motivated to create quality of life resources that increase the ease of use in everyday applications. I also wish to be part of the changing, innovative environments in the IT sector and hope to take advantage of new hardware and software applications, as well as learning all the new skills and methods they create.</p>
                <p>My study path is another step in my journey to learn and adopt new skills and methods. I aim to take a variety of courses centered around software development, including software structures, games development, mobile development and more. I am also looking to study some base computer hardware and circuitry courses to better understand how the machines work and how I might better use them.</p>

                            <p>In 2021 I chose to take my first forward step into the ICT field and get the knowledge I needed to select my path in the field. This course was just a general introduction to all elements ICT and some small-scale examples of what it would look like to work in some of the fields. The course introduced me to networking, hardware repair, maintenance and building, program development and customer interactions in the IT world. Some notable examples from assignments were building an office network from scratch using a Windows Server OS, diagnosing and repairing PCs that had faults either in hardware or boot options, building a computer for a fictional company meeting user requirements, and writing a program that could track user input, save and output data from the inputs. This course gave me an idea of the specific knowledge needed by different industry professions and showed me my love for software development and hardware structures/interactions.</p>

Whilst I haven't been here long I have already joined and participated in several extracurricular skill building workshops such as Griffith Business plus and Science plus, as well as two academic skill workshops. I also recently attended the THETA conference in Brisbane as a volunteer with Griffith's help and made some new connections there.</p>

                            <p>During my final years of high school I joined the Cairns State High School Technical Theatre team, which is an extra-curricular class where students are taught how to operate a functional, commercial theater. It included basic school events that may have required the use of AV or lighting elements, as well as outside hire events that needed AV/lighting system. While there I found it was something I was very passionate about and committed as much time as I could to the development of my skills using the system as well as a few other universal skills. During my team at the theatre, I quickly proved I could lead a team of my peers to independently run events without problem and it was during this time that I picked up amongst leadership, my troubleshooting skills, interpersonal and some customer relations skills, as well as time management and planning skills. While not directly related to my chosen path of ICT, working in the theatre gave me the base skills I need to grow in IT and proved my passion in a technology related field.</p>
